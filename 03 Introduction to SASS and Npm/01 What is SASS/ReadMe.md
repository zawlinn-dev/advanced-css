# What is SASS and How does it work? &mdash;

Sass is a CSS preprocessor, an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language.

SASS Source Code => sass compiler => compiled CSS code

## Main SASS Features &mdash;

- `Variable` : For reusable values such as colors, font-size, spacing and etc:
- `Nesting` : to nest selectors inside of one another, allowing us to write less code;
- `Operators` : for mathematical operations right inside of CSS;
- `Partials and imports` : to write CSS in different files and importing them all into one signle file;
- `Mixins` : to write reusable pieces of CSS code;
- `Functions` : similar to mixins, with the difference that they produce a value that can be used;
- `Extend` : to make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them;
- `Control directives` : for writing complex code using conditionals and loops (not covered in this course)
